# IRLS Algorithm [Advanced Machine Learning]

Implementation of Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimization algorithm for Logistic Regression from scratch. 

This project compares a custom implementation with standard ML classifiers on synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Experiments:
1. Synthetic Data: Linearly separable dataset & Non-linear dataset. Testing a model with and without interaction terms
Key observation: Interaction terms improve performance on non-linear synthetic data.
2. Real-World Datasets
  2.1 South African Heart Disease (SAheart)
  2.2 Water Potability Dataset
